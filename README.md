# Hostel-Management-System
The "Hostel Management System" software product will be an web application that will be used to keep  track of records in an organized manner and to eliminate the use of old paper in the system. This  project intends to automate hostel management in order to ensure that the hostel runs well by  automating practically all computations and accounting tasks.
